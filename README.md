# CS300---DSA-Analysis-and-Design

For this course, I was asked write school course scheduling program. Courses were loaded from a CSV file and into one of three data structures. The available data structures were linked lists, hash tables, binary search trees. 

I used Big O notation and what I learned about these data structures to determine the most efficient way to store the course data. First, I wrote pseudocode for the essential program functions and used Big O notation to calculate their runtime complexities. Then, I looked at the pros and cons between the three different data structures. Since the data needed to be sorted, I decided that it was best to use a binary search tree (BST) to store the data since data is automatically sorted when inserted into the tree.

Although I had some difficulty implementing the BST functions at first, I was able to overcome this obstacle by rereading the course material and doing my own research.

Working on this project emphasized the importance of optimization and algorithm efficiency. In my future role as a software engineer, I will do my best to ensure that the algorithms I write are as efficient as possible.
